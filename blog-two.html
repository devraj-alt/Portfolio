        Hello world, my name is Devraj Roy and I am learning web development
        with Tanay Pratap. Am writing this blog to tell you How I started my
        programming journey…
      </p>
      <p class="blog-para">
        I live in Guwahati a small city of NorthEast India. I completed my
        Higher Secondary in 2014. I did not study college. Since I did not had a
        college degree I struggled to find a good job.
        <br />
        <br />
        I worked as a food delivery guy, worked in a drug store, in a warehouse.
        In 2020 I lost my job. I didn’t know what am going to do back then. My
        financial situation from bad got to worst. I continued searching for job
        but No Vacancies.

        In April 2021 a good friend of mine Jowel Tisso asked me to try
        programming. He was already working as a freelance app developer. He
        told me about neogcamp and Tanay Pratap’s level 0.
        <br />
        <br />
        At first I told him programming wasn’t for me. But I started watching
        Tanay Pratap’s video on YouTube and started following him on Instagram.
        Eventually I thought to give it a try and started with level 0.

      <p class="blog-para">
        For a newbie like me who has no coding experience before level 0 is
        perfect start. The way Tanay Pratap explains everything and how course
        is prepared for beginners is awesome.
        <br />
        <br />
        During level 0 programming I learned JavaScript, HTML, CSS, GitHub &
        Hosting my first site. I made several applications like travel
        recommendations app, emoji interpret, fun quiz app and many more.
        <br />
        <br />
        I like to code now I can be rest assured of good future in this field.
        Programming doesn’t require good grades or a college degree as long as
        am ready to work hard.
